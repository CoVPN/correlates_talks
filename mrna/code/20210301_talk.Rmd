## Outline

- GitHub repo
- AWS set up
- Report building
- Report output
- Double coding
- Next steps

```{r, set-options, echo = FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(
  collapse = TRUE,
  out.width = "80%",
  fig.align = "center",
  fig.width = 6,
  fig.asp = 0.618,
  fig.retina = 0.8,
  fig.show = "hold",
  dpi = 300,
  echo = FALSE,
  message = FALSE,
  warning = FALSE
)
```

## [CoVPN GitHub repository](https://github.com/CoVPN)

```{r, pic-of-repo, out.width = "60%"}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("fig", "githubrepo.png"))
```

- `correlates_reporting` = .red[directory for analysis code]
- `correlates_mockdata` = __directory for practice data__
- `CovidCorrSAP` = soon to be deprecated.

## [correlates_reporting repository](https://github.com/CoVPN/correlates_reporting)

```{r, pic-of-correlates-repo, out.width = "80%"}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("fig", "reportingrepo.png"))
```

## [correlates_reporting repository](https://github.com/CoVPN/correlates_reporting)

__"Pre-processing"__
- `data_raw` = location where raw data should be deposited
- `base_riskscore` = developing risk score using placebo-recipients

__Immunogenicity report__
- `immuno_graphical` = graphical representations of immune assays
- `immuno_tabular` = tabular descriptions of immune assays

__Correlates of risk report (Tier 1A)__
- `cor_graphical` = graphical descriptions stratified by case status
- `cor_coxph` = Cox model-based estimates of risk

---

## AWS build instructions

[build_instructions.md](https://github.com/CoVPN/correlates_reporting/blob/master/build_instructions.md)

```{r, build-instruct, out.width = "75%"}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("fig", "build_instructions.png"))
```

---

## Build instructions

The image build takes about 1 hour total.
- Install `R`
- Set up GitHub credentials and clone repository
- Download `R` packages using `renv`

After the `R` setup is complete, reports can be generated as follows.


```{bash, eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE}
make data_processed

# immunogenicity report
# takes ~10 minutes
make immuno_analysis
make immuno_report

# cor report
# takes ~30 minutes
make cor_analysis
make cor_report
```

---

## Compute

To build these reports, there are a few computationally intensive steps.
- Bootstrap, permutation tests, super learner for risk score

The code is parallelized where possible.
- Will work on any Linux AWS AMI; can adjust cores as required.
- Could be built to work on Windows AMI as well.

Somewhere around 50 vCPUs should be sufficient.
- As low as 20 is likely do-able.

---

## Report output

A `pdf` for each report is saved. 

Very rough drafts are available for browsing.
- [immunogenicity report](https://www.dropbox.com/s/ykv4ij8xmch0zyk/covpn_correlates_immuno.pdf?dl=0)
- [correlates of risk report](https://www.dropbox.com/s/50bep9g561oa7n3/covpn_correlates_cor.pdf?dl=0)

Major infrastructure in place; time for smaller tweaks!

---

## Code verification

All key analyses are undergoing __code verification__.

__Each key analysis will include__:
- specification document
  - exact steps needed to reproduce the analysis
- independent analyst's code 
  - written based on the specification document only
- verification documentation 
  - finding equivalence between results across both sets of code

Code verification underway for each of the main analyses.

## Next steps

- formatting tweaks for reports
- nonparametric threshold methods in correlates report
- improvements to build command chains
